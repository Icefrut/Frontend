  [Verse 1]
So it's into the Void
Now me girls and me boys
From Mother's hands we go
We'll be be sailing to the sun
Till the voyage is done
Then we'll be sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus]
Sisters! Below, below
We're going where the winds don't blow
Yes we're all bound down
To the deep and we'll all be
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Sleeping in the cold below
[Verse 2]
Our sailing ship
Is for the hard and the quick
We roll our load and go
There's a living to be madе
Or there's Hell to pay
Whеn you're sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus]
Sisters! Below, below
We're going where the winds don't blow
Yes we're all bound down
To the deep and we'll all be
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Sleeping in the cold below

[Verse 3]
There's a man on high
With the Devil in his eye
And a golden hand, I'm told
It can hurt you, it can hold you
He can kick you or console you
When you're sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus]
Sisters! Below, below
We're going where the winds don't blow
Yes we're all bound down
To the deep and we'll all be
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Sleeping in the cold below
[Bridge]
Oh Sisters you
So wise and true
When it's my time to go
Won't you lay me down
Under Granum Crowns
And I'll be sleeping in the cold below, below
Sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus] x2
Sisters! Below, below
We're going where the winds don't blow
Yes we're all bound down
To the deep and we'll be
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Sleeping in the cold below

[Outro]
Today we sail
On the Solar Rail
For there's much we just don't know
So farewell with a kiss
Then it's fast for the mist
Till we're all sleeping in the cold below

[Verse 1]
So it's into the Void
Now me girls and me boys
From Mother's hands we go
We'll be be sailing to the sun
Till the voyage is done
Then we'll be sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus]
Sisters! Below, below
We're going where the winds don't blow
Yes we're all bound down
To the deep and we'll all be
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Sleeping in the cold below
