    <h2>Song text</h2>
    <pre>[Verse 1]
    So it's into the Void
    Now me girls and me boys
    From Mother's hands we go
    We'll be be sailing to the sun
    Till the voyage is done
    Then we'll be sleeping in the cold below

    [Chorus]
    Sisters! Below, below
    We're going where the winds don't blow
    Yes we're all bound down
    To the deep and we'll all be
    Sleeping in the cold below, below
    Sleeping in the cold below

    [Verse 2]
    Our sailing ship
    Is for the hard and the quick
    We roll our load and go
    There's a living to be madе
    Or there's Hell to pay
    Whеn you're sleeping in the cold below

    [Chorus]
    Sisters! Below, below
    We're going where the winds don't blow
    Yes we're all bound down
    To the deep and we'll all be
    Sleeping in the cold below, below
    Sleeping in the cold below

    [Verse 3]

    There's a man on high
    With the Devil in his eye
    And a golden hand, I'm told
    It can hurt you, it can hold you
    He can kick you or console you
    When you're sleeping in the cold below

    [Chorus]
    Sisters! Below, below
    We're going where the winds don't blow
    Yes we're all bound down
    To the deep and we'll all be
    Sleeping in the cold below, below
    Sleeping in the cold below

    [Bridge]
    Oh Sisters you
    So wise and true
    When it's my time to go
    Won't you lay me down
    Under Granum Crowns
    And I'll be sleeping in the cold below, below
    Sleeping in the cold below

    [Chorus] x2
    Sisters! Below, below
    We're going where the winds don't blow
    Yes we're all bound down
    To the deep and we'll be
    Sleeping in the cold below, below
    Sleeping in the cold below</pre>
